# DSA
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) repository!

In this repository, you will find a collection of code implementations and valuable resources from my DSA course at my college, IIITD. This includes lecture slides, homework assignments, and lab materials, all carefully organized for easy navigation and reference. Throughout the course, I have worked on various algorithms and data structures, gaining a deeper understanding of their theoretical foundations and practical applications. By sharing my work in this repository, I hope to contribute to the learning community and assist my fellow juniors.

Feel free to explore, study, and use the resources available in this repository to enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms. If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvement, please don't hesitate to raise an issue or submit a pull request.

I strongly advise all viewers to refrain from using this material in any unethical manner. Please engage with the content responsibly, leveraging it as a tool for study, review, and inspiration to develop your own unique solutions and understanding of DSA.
