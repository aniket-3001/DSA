// Given a Binary Search Tree which is also a Complete Binary Tree.
// The problem is to convert a given BST into a Special Max Heap with the condition that all the values in the left subtree of a node should be less than all the values in the right subtree of the node. 
// This condition is applied to all the nodes in the so-converted Max Heap.
